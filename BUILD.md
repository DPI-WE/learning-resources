# Build

## Build a Project

Reading books and doing courses is useful, but not as useful as working on real projects. A great way to cement your learning is by building out a project from scratch. As you're working through tutorials and courses in new frameworks and languages, start thinking about ways you can put these skills to use in a new project. We will use this (adjusted) final project rubric as a guide to assess your project.

## Contribute to Open Source

1. "Open Source" simply means you can look at the code yourself and make a contribution.
- You can open any Ruby gem and inspect the source code. The best way to get better at writing code is by reading other people's code.
- Check out the GitHub repository (eg https://github.com/rails/rails)
- `bundle open <name-of-gem>` (eg `bundle open rails`)
- `gem open <name-of-gem>` (eg `gem open rails`)

All of these open source libraries are listed on https://rubygems.org. If you're feeling bold, you can try creating your own Ruby Gem ðŸ’Ž

2. Review issues for known bugs. Browse actual open-source projects on GitHub looking for "good first issue" or "beginner-friendly" tags.

3. Contributing to an open source project in GitHub usually requires forking, cloning, making changes, and then submitting a pull request to the project. See `contributing` section in README for guidance.

**Activity**: Make a contribution to open source and share a link/screenshot of your contribution. Share knowledge, submit an issue, ask a question, review a pull request, work on a bounty etc. You may even submit an issue for an assignment or slide deck if you think there is a bug or something is not clear.

## Build Freelance Projects

It can be intimidating to start taking on freelance projects, but the instructors are here to guide you (which is amazing, I would have killed for that). Keep posting questions on Discord and reaching out for support. Happy to help.

It could be your own ideas, friends' ideas, small freelance projects that you find through your network or [Upwork](https://upwork.com/), [Beginner Bounties](https://beginnerbounties.com/), etc.
